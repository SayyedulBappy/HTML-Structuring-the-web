		<img src="images/dinosaur.jpg" />

		<!-- You could embed the image using its absolute URL -->
		<img src="https://www.example.com/images/dinosaur.jpg" />

		<!-- Alternative text -->
		<img
			src="images/dinosaur.jpg"
			alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton;
          it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
		/>

		<!-- Width and height -->
